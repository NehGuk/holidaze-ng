## Summary

This project has been delivered as part of my Frontend Development programme at the Norwegian School of Technology and Digital Media, Noroff. It consists of a React frontend based on an API provided by the school. It is a platform where travellers can find venues to book and where venue owners can manage their properties.

## Design

The AA-compliant colour palette for this project is inspired by a 1596 painting called _View of Toledo_, by Domḗnikos Theotokópoulos. Travelling is the main theme of this painting -- the artist was a traveller himself. I found it would be a fitting starting point to develop the colour palette for the Holidaze project:
